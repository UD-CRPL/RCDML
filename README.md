# RCDML

Welcome to the RCDML Project!

The RNA-seq Count Drug-response Machine Learning (RCDML) Workflow is a ML workflow that can be used for drug response classification of rare disease patients. Given drug response data and RNA-seq count data, the model follows the ML workflow below to classify patients as "high responder" or "low responder" for a given inhibitor.

The ML pipeline was evaluated using RNA-seq count and drug response data available for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients and over 100 different drugs as part of the BeatAML project.

For documentation on how to get started with the ML worflow visit the [wiki](https://github.com/UD-CRPL/RCDML/wiki).
